## ASSIGNMENT 6 - Branch Prediction and DMEM Delay

This is the last of the assignment for the Computer Organisation Course. We are allowed to imlement our project of interest with sufficient sophistication.

We chose to implement 
1. Statistic based Branch Prediction in hard-to-predict looping programs
2. DMEM delay setup to simulate the behaviours of general external harware devises.

This assignment was done in collaboration with Sundar Raman(EE17B069)
