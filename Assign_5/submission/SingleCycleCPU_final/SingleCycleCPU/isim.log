Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
Finished circuit initialization process.
ERROR: at 145 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "/home/sundar/Desktop/comporg/a3.1/SingleCycleCPU_final/SingleCycleCPU/peripheral.v" Line 20. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.
